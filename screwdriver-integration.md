### run in `screwdriver`

- run `npm install` at `screwdriver`

  ```
  % npm install
  ```

- To work with `postgresql` as a dialect, we need to add `pg`, `pg-hstore`, also `pg-native` just in case.

    - check this page [link](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/dialect-specific-things.html#postgresql)
      - [pg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) 
      - [pg-hstore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg-hstore)
      - [pg-native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg-native)

- edit `config/local.yaml`
